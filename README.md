# üõçÔ∏è Omnichannel Sales Pipeline Project

A complete data engineering project that unifies sales data from **Shopify (e-commerce)** and **Walmart (in-store)** into a single PostgreSQL/Snowflake data warehouse. The pipeline is fully automated using **Airflow**, transformed using **dbt**, and visualized with **Google Looker Studio**.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

A mid-sized retailer operating both an online store (via Shopify) and a chain of physical stores (selling through Walmart) wants to unify its sales data into a centralized data warehouse. By consolidating e-commerce and in-store transactions, the business will be able to:
Track revenue across channels: Compare online vs. in-store sales performance in real time.
Identify best-selling products: Determine top products overall and by channel to optimize inventory stocking.
Analyze customer purchasing behavior: Understand how customers shop across channels and tailor marketing (e.g. what products are frequently bought together).
Reduce operational inefficiencies: Eliminate manual reconciliation of separate reports, saving time and reducing errors.
This integrated view of omnichannel sales will enable data-driven decisions on pricing, promotions, and supply chain. In summary, the project will build a fully automated data pipeline that ingests, processes, and visualizes omnichannel sales data, empowering the retailer with timely insights to remain competitive.

## üß± Tech Stack

| Layer          | Tool                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Orchestration  | Apache Airflow          |
| Data Warehouse | Snowflake or PostgreSQL |
| Transformation| dbt Core                |
| Visualization  | Google Looker Studio    |
| Data Sources   | Shopify JSON, Walmart CSV |

## üì¶ Data Sources

### 1. Shopify E-commerce Data (JSON)
Simulated dataset containing:
- Order dates
- Customer info
- Product SKUs
- Quantity and revenue

### 2. Walmart In-store Data (CSV)
Historical dataset containing:
- Product categories
- Store locations
- Units sold and revenue

---

## üß™ ETL Pipeline Architecture

### 1. **Extract & Load**
- Shopify (JSON) and Walmart (CSV) files ingested daily
- Data loaded into **Snowflake staging tables**

### 2. **Transform (dbt)**
- Clean & standardize both datasets (SKUs, dates, categories)
- Merge into a **star schema**:
  - Fact table: `sales_transactions`
  - Dimension tables: `products`, `stores`, `customers`, `dates`

### 3. **Visualize**
- Looker Studio dashboard connected to the warehouse
- Dynamic filters by:
  - Channel (Online vs In-Store)
  - Product
  - Store
  - Time range

## üìä Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI                            | Goal                             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Data Completeness           | No missing/mismatched records   |
| ‚ö° ETL Runtime                 | < 5 minutes daily               |
| üìà Dashboard Freshness        | Daily auto-refresh              |

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key business questions explored before modeling:
- Which channel drives higher revenue?
- How do seasonal sales patterns differ?
- Are there popular product bundles?
- Which Walmart store locations perform best?
