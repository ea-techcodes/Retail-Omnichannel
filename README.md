## üõçÔ∏è Omnichannel Sales Pipeline Project

A complete data engineering project that unifies sales data from **Shopify (e-commerce)** and **Walmart (in-store)** into a single PostgreSQL/Snowflake data warehouse. The pipeline is fully automated using **Airflow**, transformed using **dbt**, and visualized with **Google Looker Studio**.

# üöÄ Project Overview

A mid-sized retailer selling through both Shopify (online) and Walmart (in-store) needs to unify its sales data into a single data warehouse. This will allow the business to track revenue by channel, identify top-selling products, and better understand customer behavior. By automating data collection and analysis, the company can reduce manual work and improve decision-making. The end goal is a real-time, centralized analytics system that supports smarter pricing, promotions, and inventory planning.

## üì¶ Data Sources

### 1. Shopify E-commerce Data (JSON)
Simulated dataset containing:
- Order dates
- Customer info
- Product SKUs
- Quantity and revenue

### 2. Walmart In-store Data (CSV)
Historical dataset containing:
- Product categories
- Store locations
- Units sold and revenue

---

## üß™ ETL Pipeline Architecture

### 1. **Extract & Load**
- Shopify (JSON) and Walmart (CSV) files ingested daily
- Data loaded into **Snowflake staging tables**

### 2. **Transform (dbt)**
- Clean & standardize both datasets (SKUs, dates, categories)
- Merge into a **star schema**:
  - Fact table: `sales_transactions`
  - Dimension tables: `products`, `stores`, `customers`, `dates`

### 3. **Visualize**
- Looker Studio dashboard connected to the warehouse
- Dynamic filters by:
  - Channel (Online vs In-Store)
  - Product
  - Store
  - Time range

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key business questions explored before modeling:
- Which channel drives higher revenue?
- How do seasonal sales patterns differ?
- Are there popular product bundles?
- Which Walmart store locations perform best?
